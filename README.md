# restaurant-website
 Restaurant website written in JS using webpack and ES6 Modules. 

   This is my first time working with a compiler and splitting my code into modules, and I'm anticipating it will teach me a lot about more complex file structures, and debugging with compiled code. 

   Initially from the documentation, I found the webpack setup a bit confusing but after doing a day or two of research to make sure I really understood what was going on, I got the site bundled, and up and running on Github Pages. I predict that from learning about how to think about code and file structure in this modular way, when I move on to learn React next I'll be better prepared to break the site down into components. Overall this was a good way to significantly clean up my code, make it easier to read and maintain, and learn how to use SASS, Webpack and NPM.
